# Coding-1-Final

My website includes picture of the mountains, because I love the outdoors.
It consists of three pages a home page, about page, and a contact page. 

The home page currently has a carousel with three pictures of mountains.
The reason I added mountains was because I love the outdoors.

The about page has a paragraph tag with information about myself. Also the page has the logo of the college I am planning to attend which is Tennessee Tech University.

The contact page has my email, phone number, and what state I live in. This lets people contact me if they need to. 

Then my footer has my live link to my website.
